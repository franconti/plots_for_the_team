"""This code was created to assist in plotting the results of taste panel sessions. 
Within the company, numerous tasting panels were conducted to compare different products. 
During these panels, customers were required to rank the likelihood of enjoying various products on a scale from 1 to 9. 
The primary purpose of this plot is to categorize the votes into three distinct groups ("1-3", "4-6", "7-9") and subsequently compare 
which products were the most favored.
